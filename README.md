# Complex function grapher.

## This python script graphs complex argument functions using HSL.

## Instructions:
1. You can change the function by changing the fz variable (z is the complex argument).
2. You can change the graphing bounds by changing np.linspace() bounds in x and y.
3. n is the number of pixels per axis.
4. Now you can launch the script and see the function.
